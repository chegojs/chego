1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.

## Quickie Code Style Guide

- Use 4 spaces for tabs, never tab characters.
- No trailing whitespace, blank lines should have no whitespace.
- Always favor strict equals `===` unless you *need* to use type coercion.
- Follow conventions already in the code, and listen to tslint.
- Ensure changes are tslint validated.
